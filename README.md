- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arpit
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a graduate Student At Carnegie Mellon University, where i'm taking some of the best courses on Machine Learning  and working with the brightest minds to use AI to Solve Impactful problems
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Artifical Intelligence and the math that powers it.
- I've had experience in all things Machine Learning. from building models state of the art models, implementing research papers to designing real-time data-focused automated model monitoring, testing, data cleaning, drift detection,model retraining, and canary releases to operationalize the models into production.
- I've done projects on 3-D computer vision, Vision language models, Generative Models such as GANs, Diffusion, VAE, LLMs, VLMs, Object detection, Activity Tracking.
